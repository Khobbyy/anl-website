            agony of the weak and the poor through a support system in which the
            wealthy absorb the financial difficulties of the needy. Based on
            this belief, the weak and the poor, the aged and vulnerable, the
            destitute insolvent and others are continually maintained by the
            strong, privileged and generous. <br />

            wood sculpture is produced from half o f a tree trunk that has

            the tummy. Both knees are raised high, swung to the left and
