            Africa's rich cultural, intellectual, and social discourse makes it
            appealing and wealthy to embrace. Chiefdom as a central nerve of
            African culture has informed the youth about the need to orient
            themselves with their culture and possibly come to terms with the
            background, character, problems, ideas, and way of life. Samuel
            Adentwi Bentum (PhD) sees the African woman as one of the strongest
            forces within the African circle. At this exquisite exhibition saw
            the display of the following artful masterpiece and many more others
            such as Ekumfohen(Chief Executioner), Nkyenhen (Chief Drummer),
            Akyeamehen (Chief Linguist) and others.

          <p>
            Ahemfo Nhyiam is a composition of Sub-Chiefs in a horizontal plane.
            In the Akan culture, Sub-Chiefs are chosen to carry out a variety of
            tasks on behalf of the Paramount Chief. They are consequently
            expected to assist the paramount chief in her duties effectively.
            The oval perforation and crumbled form in the upper portion are
            associated with day and night or the seen and unseen world.
            Similarly, the perforations within the mid-section and baseline
            signify the efforts of the Sub-Chiefs to perform in their elected
            offices by bringing progress and development to their community.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Mpontuhen is a highly and renowned person selected from among the
            youth to the status of a chief. She has the financial might and
            charisma to ensure the development of her community. She is satiated
            with wealth, ideas, thoughts and good omen that are significant for
            the community’s economic and social progress. Mpontuhen is not a
            born elite; she is not born to the royal lineage. The presence of
            the state mace and the acclamation by the queen mother approves of
            their contribution to the state and the stool of their ancestors.
            Hence, the mask-like facial expression of these images that signify
            the approval and acceptance of the unseen spirits – owners of the
            land.

          <p>
            Afonahen is a chief warrior and commander general of the paramount,
            or town chief. She has the overall responsibility to protect the
            paramountcy and her subjects from reprisals, attacks,
            confrontations, and takeovers from other paramount's and
            authorities. She has the attributes of bravery, sternness, courage,
            and confidence. She is the custodian of the state sword and the
            defense commander-in-chief of the state. She has a wreath hung
            around her neck as an ornament, an act that is synonymous with Akan
            spiritual leaders. This wreath symbolizes Afonahen’s relationship
            with the seen and unseen worlds, the owners of the state, and the
            spiritual warriors of the state in the Akan culture. Afonahen is
            represented in a swearing position as a symbol of her authority over
            her sect and service to the superior leaders of the community.
